        <h1>More About Me!</h1>
    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>I'm an avid music fan, listening to everything and enjoying everything from Led Zeppelin to Noah Kahan to Alice in Chains! I've been playing guitar for 4 years now (both acoustic and electric) and have a few years of music production experience as well in my home studio.</p>
